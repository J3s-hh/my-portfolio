  <h1>Hello, I'm Jesh Santeo</h1>
  <p>
    I'm a teenager who's always curious and hungry to learn new things. Right now, I'm diving into the world of game development under the name <strong>Dwata Studio</strong> — building weird, fun, and meaningful games from the ground up.
  </p>
  <p>
    I'm also super interested in cybersecurity and working my way toward becoming a professional in that field. Whether it's making games or learning how to break (and protect) systems, I'm all in.
  </p>
  <p>
    I'm still figuring things out, but one thing's for sure — I'm not afraid to start small and keep learning every step of the way.
