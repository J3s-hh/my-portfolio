  <h1>Hey, I'm Jesh</h1>
  <p>
    I'm just a regular teenager trying to figure stuff out. Right now, I'm into making games â€” I go by <strong>Dwata Studio</strong> when I build them. I like messing around with ideas, making weird or fun things, and just seeing what works.
  </p>
  <p>
    I'm also really into cybersecurity. Hacking stuff (ethically) and learning how computers work behind the scenes is super interesting to me. Someday, I wanna go pro in that space too.
  </p>
  <p>
    I'm not perfect. Still learning, still failing, still improving. But that's the whole point, right?
  </p>

    This siteâ€™s still a work in progress â€” I know it looks kinda basic right now ðŸ˜…
